**Description**: Building a Go Application with Echo, JWT Authentication, and MongoDB

**Introduction**:
In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of building a Go application that uses the Echo web framework for creating RESTful APIs, implements JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for user authorization, and connects to a MongoDB database for data storage. This combination of technologies will help you create a robust and secure web application.

**Prerequisites**:
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following tools and libraries installed:

**Go (Golang)** - Install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

**Echo** - Install Echo using go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4

**MongoDB** - Install MongoDB and the official Go driver go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver
